\section{Conclusion}

To summarize, in order to improve the extensibility of blockchain, we are doing the following work:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Design a new programming model for blockchain to enable native extension within the blockchain.
  \item Implement a framework that aligns with this programming model.
  \item Apply it to the Artela blockchain to build a boundless network that allows developers to customize application-specific extensions for their dApps.
  \item Make the framework adaptable for integration into various blockchains to enhance their extensibility.
\end{itemize}

Next, we will focus on improving the implementation of the framework to address the real challenges in the rich-dApps ecosystem of the Artela blockchain. We will also explore public universal Aspects that dApps can reuse on the Artela blockchain. Furthermore, we will continue enhancing the generality of Aspect-Boost to enable its integration into other blockchains. In the next phase, we plan to develop a new kind of Aspect that supports heterogeneous computing and unlocks more programming models for blockchain.
